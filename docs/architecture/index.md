# Architecture

## Overview

RNode Server uses a **unique hybrid approach** where **all JavaScript code execution happens through Rust backend**. This architecture provides both advantages and challenges.

## Key Components

- **[Overview](./overview.md)** - Complete system architecture and design

## Architecture Highlights

### Hybrid Rust + Node.js
- **Rust Backend**: High-performance HTTP server with Axum
- **Node.js Integration**: JavaScript execution through Neon FFI
- **Zero-Copy Communication**: Minimal data copying between layers

### Revolutionary Promise System
- **Direct Promise Handling**: JavaScript promises awaited directly in Rust
- **Built-in Timeout**: Automatic operation cancellation
- **Status-based Errors**: Proper HTTP status codes for all errors
- **Auto Error Pages**: Beautiful HTML error pages generated by Rust

### Performance Characteristics
- **~2.7× faster** than Express.js
- **~2.7× lower** average response time
- **~2× higher** transfer rates
- **More efficient** memory and CPU usage

## Use Cases
